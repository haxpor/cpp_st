Most of the source files can be compiled via

`g++ -std=c++11 <source-file1> <source-file2> ...`

then you can execute via `./a.out`.

Most of program is a simple single source file program, thus you can judge by its file name for what
to expect. Otherwise for more complex program, it should be inside a directory.

This is by design not to have any build system.
